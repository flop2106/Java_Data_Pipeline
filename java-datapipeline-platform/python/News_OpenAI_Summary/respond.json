Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has emphasized Malaysia's strategic partnerships with the US, Europe, China, and ASEAN to seek resolutions to retaliatory tariffs imposed by the US. These tariffs, especially on furniture exports, have pressured Malaysian manufacturers to expedite sales before the full impact of the tariffs is felt. The uncertainty surrounding these trade policies has left businesses and consumers wary, prompting furniture exporters to work overtime to meet demand.\n\nMoreover, Malaysia's economy is at risk of being adversely affected by the broader ramifications of US-China trade relations. Experts warn that the region remains on an economic \"knife edge,\" as any escalation in tariffs could further slow growth. While Malaysia attempts to leverage its regional strength, the current geopolitical climate poses a risk to its economic stability and growth prospects."}}
